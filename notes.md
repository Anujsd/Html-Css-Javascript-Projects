## Need of box-sizing:border-box

For easy development.  
e.g.<br>
you have box of h=100px w=100px with padding 5px and border 5px.<br>
In default configuration you will see box with h=110px and w=110px<br>
but with border-box you will see h=100px and w=100px. those 5px padding<br>
and 5px border will be added internally like 90px element + 5px padding + 5px border<br>
